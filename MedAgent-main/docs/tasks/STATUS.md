2. **T3.03** — Base model benchmark (even lightweight 20-prompt comparison)
3. **T3.05** — Minimal `scripts/eval.py` (triage accuracy + hallucination rate)
4. **T3.11** — Run specialized tool evals + commit report
5. **T4.09** — Lighthouse performance pass
6. **T4.10** — Production deployment config (staging minimum)
